# Re-measures src/feePaymentMethod/claimFpcGasTable.ts against a running sandbox.
#
# The per-call budgets (claimFpcGasBudgets.ts) derive from two registration-gated rows and the lone
# L1-operation broadcasts, and every case that prices a per-call policy reads the budgets from the
# table as imported at process start. So the table is recorded in two passes: the first runs only
# the cases that record those rows, the second runs every fpc suite against the updated table, and
# the inventory check runs last.
#
# The recorder only upserts rows: delete a retired shape's row from the table by hand. A renamed
# shape the budgets read (a burn row, say) has to be recorded once before the second pass can price
# a per-call policy: run its suite with CLAIMFPC_GAS_REPORT=1 first.
#
# Usage, from packages/sdk: pnpm gas:record
