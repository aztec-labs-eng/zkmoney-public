/**
 * Testnet E2E: pending-record resume after process death.
 *
 * Submit `wait: NO_WAIT` (the wallet writes a `PendingTxRecord` adjacent
 * to `node.sendTx` and returns immediately, NOT polling). Force-discard
 * the wallet instance — simulating the "process died before
 * `TxLifecycleService` ever attached" case. Boot a NEW wallet pointed at
 * the SAME `IPendingTxStore`, instantiate `TxLifecycleService` with that
 * store, call `resumeAll()`. Assert the pending record is reconciled:
 * the unified poll observes the original mining, calls
 * `pendingTxStore.remove(txHash)`, and patches `TransactionStorage`
 * status.
 *
 * Validates the pending-record-resume fix on real network under the
 * merged `TxLifecycleService` design.
 *
 * **Manual / pre-merge gate.** Skipped via `TESTNET_SKIP=1`.
