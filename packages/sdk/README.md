# @obsidion/sdk

## What belongs here

Direct contract interaction. Anything that calls `contract.methods.doFunc()` against a deployed
instance, models types around on-chain values, drives account-contract interaction (entrypoints,
nullifiers, witness derivation), or deploys contracts. Re-exports from `@obsidion/contracts` (and
therefore `@obsidion/core`) for backward compatibility.

**Calling an Aztec NODE is NOT contract interaction.** A `createAztecNodeClient`

- `node.getBlockNumber()` call hits the node's RPC, not a contract. Code that does only that and
  then runs business logic belongs in `@obsidion/front-core`. The line is: contract method calls
  earn you sdk; node RPC alone does not.

What does NOT belong here:

- Storage classes, HTTP services, in-memory aggregators, or any persistence-/orchestration-layer
  code → `@obsidion/front-core`. All current storage classes live in
  front-core; this package no longer hosts persistence.
- Browser-only runtime adapters → `web-wallet/src/`.
- Noir source or codegen pipeline → `@obsidion/contracts`.
