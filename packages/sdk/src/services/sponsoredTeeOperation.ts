/**
 * TEE-attested oxide-token operations under ClaimFPC sponsorship — the
 * composition of `buildTeeOperation` (single-sim staged execution, TEE
 * signing, capsule assembly, `publish_da`) with `buildClaimSponsorPayload`
 * (NO_FROM entrypoint batches).
 *
 * Shape parity with the account-entrypoint variant, with two differences the
 * sponsored batch imposes:
 *   - calls are `FunctionCall` structs dispatched by the FPC, matched against
 *     its policy (the shipped single `ByAny` entry matches them all; class
 *     witnesses are still supplied so a per-call ByClass policy also matches),
 *     not an account `BatchCall`;
 *   - capsules ride the ExecutionPayload tx-globally (`extraCapsules`) —
 *     they are keyed by (contract, slot), so per-call attachment was never
 *     load-bearing.
 *
 * Batch layout (MAX_SPONSORED_CALLS = 5): [account auth?, ...ops, ...teeUnsignedInteractions,
 * ...finalization requests, publish_da].
