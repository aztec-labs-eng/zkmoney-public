/**
 * Permissionless ClaimFPC top-up: after a wallet's own L2 ops, check the FPC's fee-juice balance
 * and, below a threshold, consume one in-flight skim-funding message via the FPC's `refuel`
 * entrypoint. The FPC pays for the tx out of the claimed amount itself (`claim_and_end_setup`),
 * so this needs no user account, no signature, and no FPC balance.
 *
 * Everything is recoverable from chain + the FPC's own config: candidate messages come from the
 * canonical FeeJuicePortal's `DepositToAztecPublic` L1 logs filtered by recipient, and the claim
 * secret is public (oxide's `PORTAL_CONSTANT_SECRET`, mirrored in `config.claim_secret`). Losing a claim race to
 * another wallet is the expected common case and costs only local proving time — the duplicate
 * message nullifier drops the tx before any fee is charged.
