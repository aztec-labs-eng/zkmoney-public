/**
 * Assemble a batched operation against one token as a *staged* send: the
 * simulation-shape `BatchCall` plus a {@link PayloadFinalizer} that maps the
 * wallet's pre-simulation result to the production (TEE-signed) payload. The
 * caller owns dispatch (so `wallet.sendTx` runs and the full
 * proving-progress / persist pipeline fires); the wallet owns the
 * single simulation that feeds BOTH the TEE attestation and its own
 * authwit-capture / gas-estimation pass, plus the PXE sync point and the
 * gas pricing of the finalize delta (see `obsidion/stagedExecution.ts`).
 *
 * For the `Operation` variants this helper batches (`transfer` / `withdraw` /
 * `outerCall`), see the canonical type definition at
 * `src/oxide/l2_operations.ts` — in particular the `outerCall` JSDoc, which
 * documents the cross-contract dispatch contract (no `from` field,
 * `additionalScopes` for outer-contract-owned notes, etc.).
 *
 * **Forked from** oxide-client's `submit()` (`oxide-client/src/l2_operations.ts`),
 * built from its bindings-free pieces. Differences from upstream:
 *
 *   1. `from` → `batchSender`: the tx originator, not necessarily the note owner.
 *      Paylink claim/refund use `op.from = paylink.address` while `batchSender` is the
 *      claimer or depositor; the TEE's owner-preimage check guards spends.
 *   2. No dispatch: returns the unsent simulation-shape `BatchCall` + a `sendOpts`
 *      sidecar (`fee`, `additionalScopes`, `finalize`), because `BatchCall` has no
 *      `.with()` method.
 *   3. `buildOperationCall` is a caller closure (token side calls the token's
 *      `transfer`/`withdraw`; paylink side calls the paylink contract), and an
 *      `outerCall` operation declares the withdrawals its nested token call makes.
 *   4. `additionalScopes` for outer-contract-owned notes.
 *   5. No pre-simulation here: the wallet's own kernelless simulation inside
 *      `sendTx` feeds `sendOpts.finalize`. The seed capsule derives note randomness
 *      from the seed, not the tx nonce, so the finalized batch reproduces exactly the
 *      notes that simulation produced and the TEE attested.
 *   6. Every withdrawal must broadcast its finalization request, and a plain one is
 *      checked to leave the executor its relayer tip.
 *
 * INVARIANTS:
 *   - `sendOpts.fee` carries `paymentMethod` only — no `gasSettings`. The
 *     shallow-merge contract in `sendAndWait` relies on this.
 *   - The token operation and the sign output are nullifier-material-bearing:
 *     they stay inside the finalizer and are never returned or logged.
