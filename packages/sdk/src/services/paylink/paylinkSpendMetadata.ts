/**
 * Build a `SpendMetadataResolver` for a paylink-contract-owned note.
 *
 * The paylink contract holds the locked funds between deposit and claim/refund.
 * To nullify that note, oxide's TEE needs the paylink contract's `CompleteAddress`
 * (rebuilt from the link's public keys) and its master-nullifier-hiding key
 * (derived from the link's `secret`). The resolver fails loudly if the simulated
 * call nullifies anything other than the paylink contract's own note.
 *
 * @param paylinkInstance - The reconstructed contract instance whose address must
 *                          match `nullified.owner` for the asserted note.
 * @param depositTxHash - The link's funding tx, when it carries one. Otherwise the note's own
 *                        `creationTxHash` serves — the token contract emits it for every settled
 *                        note, and the escrow note is always settled by the time it is spent.
 * @param paylinkKeys - Reconstructed key material. The nullifier-hiding key comes from `secret`;
 *                      the escape door's fallback key only from the creator's material.
