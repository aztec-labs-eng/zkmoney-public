/**
 * Gas model for ClaimFPC's per-call policy entries.
 *
 * The kernel meters a transaction on what it emits: nullifiers, note hashes, private-log fields and
 * L2->L1 messages. This file lists what each sponsorable call emits and prices it with the kernel's
 * constants, so a per-call entry's `max_fee` is a worst-case shape, not a measured sample plus a
 * fudge factor. The deploy prices these shapes into the entries (backend claimFpcConfig.ts) and the
 * wallet declares the same shapes as a batch's gas limits (`claimFpcBatchGas`); the FPC compares
 * declared limits against the entries, so both sides have to agree.
 *
 * Three words used throughout:
 *   - side effects: what a call emits, as the kernel counts it (`SideEffects`).
 *   - marginal: the gas one batched call adds on top of the entrypoint overhead the FPC charges
 *     anyway (`CLAIM_FPC_OVERHEAD_GAS`, the "base").
 *   - AVM execution gas: when a tx enqueues public calls, the whole tx is metered at the AVM's
 *     rates and the public call's own execution costs gas too. That last part cannot be derived
 *     from counts, so it is read off a measured tx and carried as a constant.
 *
 * The FPC budgets a batch as the base plus one entry per call, so every entry has to hold whatever
 * else rides the batch. Once any call enqueues a public call the whole tx pays AVM rates, and each
 * AVM rate is at least its private one. So every entry prices its own call's side effects at AVM
 * rates, and a call that enqueues public calls also carries the public surcharge (see
 * `publicCallSurcharge`). publish_da runs once per batch, so its capsule ceiling is its own entry.
 * Two public-call entries in one batch both carry the surcharge's per-tx part; nothing else is
 * counted twice.
 *
 * Shapes fall in three groups:
 *   - Fixed private shapes (authorize_intents, the registration gate, gift_voucher, the SIPA
 *     notify): the side-effect model must equal the measured table to the gas.
 *   - Spends (transfer, withdraw, paylink deposit): the oxide token spends notes through a recursion
 *     ladder, so these are budgeted at the ladder's sponsored maximum.
 *   - Public calls (L1-operation broadcasts, the email paylink's registry view): their execution gas
 *     is read off a measured tx.
