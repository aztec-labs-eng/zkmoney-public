/**
 * Gas limits a ClaimFPC-sponsored tx must declare — the same numbers the deployed policy's budget
 * was priced from.
 *
 * WHY THE CLIENT HAS TO DECLARE THEM. `_assert_fee_within_max` (claim_fpc/src/main.nr) bounds
 * `(gas_limits + teardown_gas_limits) x max_fees_per_gas`, i.e. what the tx DECLARES, not what it
 * spends. Left to default, upstream declares the network's per-tx admission ceiling for a send and
 * three times the per-checkpoint processable maximum for a gas-estimation simulation — an order of
 * magnitude above a per-call inventory, which rejects every such tx outright, and ~3x the flat caps,
 * which leaves an open policy one fee uptick from the same fate (pinned in
 * claimFpcGasInventory.test.ts). Declaring the policy's own numbers makes the assert reduce to the
 * one comparison it is meant to be: the tx's fee-per-gas against the fee-per-gas the FPC sponsors
 * at.
 *
 * TWO REGIMES, ONE PER POLICY SHAPE (`claimFpcDeclaredGas` picks by the policy the FPC committed):
 *   - A policy with a `ByAny` entry sponsors any private non-FPC call, so no per-call inventory
 *     exists to declare: the batch declares the flat `CLAIM_FPC_MAX_BATCH_{DA,L2}_GAS` caps, which
 *     the deploy priced into that entry's per-batch `max_fee`.
 *   - A per-call policy budgets each committed call separately, so the batch declares the
 *     inventory: the entrypoint overhead plus every call's marginal, mirroring
 *     `_entrypoint_preamble`'s `batch_max_fee` in gas terms.
 *
 * Either way the headroom against a rising base fee is exactly
 * `config.max_fee_per_l2_gas / declared fee-per-gas`, and sponsorship pauses when that reaches 1 —
 * the drain brake the immutable config is meant to have, not a bug.
 *
 * Declared limits also bound execution: a batch that meters above what it declared runs out of gas
 * instead of being sponsored. Under the caps that headroom is deliberate slack; under an inventory
 * declaration it is the whitelist ceiling's own refusal (the fee assert would reject the batch),
 * moved earlier and made explicit.
