/**
 * The ClaimFPC gas budgets: what each sponsorable call may cost, checked against the measured table
 * (CLAIM_FPC_GAS_TABLE) before anything uses the numbers.
 *
 * Three consumers, one derivation. A per-call deploy prices these into its entries' `max_fee`
 * (backend claimFpcConfig.ts adds the fee-per-gas); a wallet under such a policy declares them as
 * a sponsored tx's gas limits (`claimFpcBatchGas`); and the flat caps the shipped open policy uses
 * are sized against them. The circuit compares declared limits times fee-per-gas with the batch's
 * budget, so the deploy and the client must use the same numbers: a batch that declares more gas
 * than its budget cannot be proven at any price.
 *
 * The base — the entrypoint's own overhead — is the contract's `CLAIM_FPC_OVERHEAD_GAS`, charged
 * once per batch. Each entry budgets the worst case of its call from the side-effect model
 * (claimFpcGasModel.ts). The table is the check on the model: fixed shapes must match it to the gas,
 * worst-case batches must cover it, and the publish_da chunking must reproduce the measured direct
 * claim. A
 * missing row or a failed check throws wherever the numbers are used; the fix is to re-measure
 * (CLAIMFPC_GAS_REPORT=1, the sdk fpc suites) and correct the model, never to guess.
