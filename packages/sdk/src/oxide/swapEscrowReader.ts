/**
 * L1 reads over a swap-on-withdraw escrow, for the client that has to notice when nobody runs the
 * swap. Oxide's relayer drops an operation whose `deployAndExecute` keeps reverting and exposes no
 * status, so the wallet watches the escrow itself: its DAI balance says whether it is still funded,
 * its code says whether a `deployAndExecute` (or deploy-only `deploy`) ever ran, and a
 * `deployAndExecute` simulation says whether the route can deliver at all.
