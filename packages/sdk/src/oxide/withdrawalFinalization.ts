// L1 finalization reads for oxide withdrawals. This is the sdk-layer home for
// the contract calls the front-core watcher must NOT originate (monorepo layering
// rule): front-core depends on the `WithdrawalFinalizationReader` interface and is
// handed a concrete reader at boot.
//
// Two reads:
//   - `isSpent`         — the authoritative per-withdrawal "finalized" signal
//                         (`OxidePortal.$isWithdrawalSpent`). Propagates RPC errors
//                         so the watcher can fail loudly / retry.
//   - `resolveL1TxHash` — a best-effort Etherscan-link lookup. Cosmetic; runs only
//                         after `isSpent` is already true, so it never throws and
//                         never blocks `done` — a missing link is fine, a wrong
//                         link is not.
