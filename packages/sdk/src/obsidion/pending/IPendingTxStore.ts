/**
 * SDK-side `IPendingTxStore` interface — the contract the wallet sees.
 *
 * Implementations:
 *   - `InMemoryPendingTxStore` (default, in this package) — Map-backed, no
 *     encryption, no persistence. Used by tests, web/Node, and any callsite
 *     that doesn't inject a persistent store.
 *   - `PendingTxStore` (in `@obsidion/front-core`) — encrypted on-disk
 *     persistent variant, injected at construction.
 *
 * Design note: the wallet imports only this interface (and `PendingTxRecord`
 * from `./types`); it never imports front-core. SDK→front-core layering is
 * preserved through interface symmetry.
