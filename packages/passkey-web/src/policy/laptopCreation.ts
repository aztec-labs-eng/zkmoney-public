/**
 * Whether a laptop may create the wallet's passkey on its own password manager ("laptop
 * creation") instead of on a phone over QR, and which managers it may use. Decided once per
 * attempt before the steps sheet opens; the sheet shows the answer and the creation driver checks
 * the manager that answered against it.
 *
 * Apple Passwords returns no key material before macOS 15. A Mac's own new passkey reads right on
 * that Mac and on iPhones, so Chromium, whose Client Hints carry the version, admits Apple from
 * macOS 15. Safari and Firefox cannot report the version: they admit Apple from the browser version
 * that labels the answer truthfully (Safari 26.4) or names its provider (Firefox 153), and an
 * Apple answer there that brings no key is refused after creation. Google Password Manager lives
 * in Chrome. 1Password's extension and the macOS passkey window both answer under its id with key
 * material, while its Windows app returns none and is refused after creation. It needs no trusted
 * attachment label: the Mac's window offers no phone for a creation on this Mac, so a 1Password
 * answer on Firefox's Mac row is this Mac's, and one without its key is refused with no follow-up.
 * Its Firefox extension gives up on production's related-origin requests, so that row offers
 * 1Password through the Mac's window alone (`extensionWithdrawn`), and Firefox on Windows and
 * Linux, which sends no Client Hints and whose row (1Password alone through the extension) is read
 * from the user-agent string, ships withdrawn. The sheet decides where it opens; the row only says
 * what is admitted.
