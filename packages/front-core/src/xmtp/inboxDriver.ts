/**
 * XmtpInboxReceiverDriver — foreground-only polling loop that walks all
 * consented XMTP conversations every 5s and dispatches payment-request and
 * connect-back messages to their receivers. (Incoming transfers are
 * chain-native — `TransferEventScanner` — and never ride XMTP.)
 *
 * Why this exists: per-conversation chat hooks only process the
 * currently-open DM. This driver runs independently of any tab / hook so
 * lifecycle messages land for every consented conversation, on a single 5s
 * cadence, while the app is foregrounded.
 *
 * Lifecycle is owned by the platform wiring:
 *   - `start()` after PXE + XMTP are both ready (idempotent)
 *   - `stop()` when the app leaves the foreground
 *   - `start()` on return to foreground
 *
 * Streaming: a stream fast-path plus a tiered backstop. The driver consumes
 * the client port's `subscribeAllMessages` / `syncAllConversations`
 * primitives; the per-conversation cursor + connect-back budget below stay
 * authoritative — the stream is only a "this conversation changed" signal,
 * never a trusted content source.
 *
 * Correctness invariants:
 *   - Cursor map is bound to the live xmtpInstallationId. On mismatch
 *     (backup-restore rotates the installation), all per-conversation
 *     cursors reset; the in-lock txHash idempotency at the store layer
 *     defends against duplicate rows on the reprocess.
 *   - Cursor advances on accepted | rejected | duplicate. On deferred
 *     (or a per-message throw), the cursor stays unmoved and the
 *     message is re-presented on the next cycle.
 *   - Cursor math is bigint (ns timestamps exceed 2^53); persisted values
 *     stay JSON numbers when losslessly representable, decimal strings
 *     otherwise.
 *   - Connect-back budget is global per pollOnce (10); when exhausted,
 *     the next cycle resumes from `resumeConversationId` so under
 *     sustained backlog every conversation is eventually visited.
 *   - All persistence happens in one storage write at end of cycle.
 *     A mid-cycle crash drops the in-memory advances; reprocessed rows
 *     hit the store-layer idempotency.
