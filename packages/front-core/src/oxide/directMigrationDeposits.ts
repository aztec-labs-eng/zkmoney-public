/**
 * Direct migration deposits: an upgrade's migration executor deposits a refund straight into the
 * destination portal under a recipient commitment, with no SIPA. No SIPA event announces it, so the
 * rail cannot learn of it from L2. Each sent direct batch therefore gets a deposit record before
 * its deposit lands, as an address this wallet handed out does. The rail reads L1 for every tracked
 * SIPA on a fixed budget of requests, and the record's commitment joins that read: the rail sees
 * the deposit, then claims it like any other sweep. The record keeps the batch's amount: the
 * commitment is public, so the rail reads it until it has claimed that amount in total, and a
 * smaller deposit from another sender does not end the read.
