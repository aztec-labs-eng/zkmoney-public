/**
 * Resolver payments, shown the moment they land on L1.
 *
 * A sender who pays a tag through the ENS resolver funds an address the resolver derived for one
 * `(day, nonce)`: an ECDH salt between the resolver's key and the account's registered stealth key,
 * where `day` is the L1 block's UTC day and the nonce counts up from 0 per account and day, one per
 * resolve. The ECDH is symmetric, so the wallet derives the same addresses from its own key. It
 * polls the ones the resolver could have handed out and records a funded one as an incoming
 * deposit straight away, instead of waiting for the resolver's L2 broadcast to reach discovery.
 *
 * The record carries the salt and the full origin, so the sync pass claims it like any other, and
 * the event discovery later finds is pinned to it by salt rather than recorded again.
