/**
 * Deposit-gated name registration (registration-fee.md: registration by deposit). The name is
 * registered by funding a registration SIPA whose address commits to the record and the owner's
 * consent; a relayer sweeps the deposit, and the sweep runs `RegistrationController.register` — writing the
 * name, paying the fee to the selected beneficiary, deploying the owner's 4337 account, installing the
 * owner's passkey (r1) key, and bridging the rest. The wallet runs no bundler and pays no gas: it signs
 * a zero-fee install UserOp with the bootstrap key, carried in the proofs, and the controller submits it
 * to the EntryPoint inside the sweep. `/domain/sign` is bootstrap-key gated, and custody is "the L1
 * deposit landed and was swept."
 *
 * One machine, two entry points. `startOxideRegistrationSession` prechecks the name, derives the
 * registration SIPA, obtains the NameClaim (+ signed terms) and the consent signature,
 * persists an `awaiting_deposit` record, and returns the deposit address with the broadcast payload,
 * which the sheet that shows the address owes to the broadcast ledger. `resumeOxideRegistration`
 * ticks the pending record from ANY point to on-chain confirmation: it reads the Registry
 * (authoritative) and observes the deposit and sweep for progress; a forced tick re-derives the
 * consent and re-requests the claim. The record exists before the claim, so no crash strands a
 * registration.
 *
 * Pure over injected collaborators (claim server client, L1 reader, SIPA deriver, broadcaster,
 * deposit reader) so the full sequence is testable without HTTP/RPC/real passkeys. Deterministic
 * key material makes it resumable: a crash mid-flow re-derives the SAME account and SIPA.
