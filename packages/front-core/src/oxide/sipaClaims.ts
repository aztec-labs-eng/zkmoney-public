/**
 * SIPA deposit sync — discovery → claim → spendable, the recipient-side
 * composition over the sdk primitives and the front-core crypto/store:
 *
 *   1. read the recipient's `SIPA` events (`shared_secret_salt` + `resweepable`)
 *      off the token (requires `setupSipaDiscovery` to have registered the
 *      senders in this PXE),
 *   2. per event, derive the recipient commitment + recoveryAddress and compute
 *      the SIPA address offline,
 *   3. observe every SIPA at once (`observeSipas`): the portal deposits its sweeps made, which
 *      carry the claim inputs and the L1→L2 message key, its transfers in and out, and its
 *      holdings — a fixed number of requests however many SIPAs,
 *   4. per unclaimed sweep, wait for settlement (`store_deposit` asserts the settled root, so
 *      claiming earlier just fails), then claim via `TokenService.claimSweptDeposit` — after which
 *      `balance_of` reflects the net amount and the next transfer spends it.
 *
 * The first `Transfer(to = sipa)` stamps the funding attribution (funder address + tx) and fires
 * the deposit-attested contact hook.
 *
 * Every known SIPA is observed every pass, settled or not, since a claimed SIPA can be paid again;
 * claims dedup by inbox index. The relayer sweeps an address once per publish, so new funds on a
 * claimed SIPA reopen its record and ask the caller to publish it again (`onSweptAddressFunded`);
 * an address that is not resweepable can only be recovered. A funded SIPA whose balance is at or
 * below the deposit floor — the relayer's sweep fee — can never be swept, so it flips to
 * `recoverable`, surfacing the `recoverERC20` exit.
 *
 * A SIPA reads its whole history once, then rides the deployment's cursor: each pass reads only the
 * blocks since the last. A sweep not yet claimable keeps its claim inputs on the record. Only the
 * claims queue on the PXE one at a time; the pass reads the balance once after its last.
 *
 * Per-event failures are isolated: one bad SIPA must not stall the rest.
 * Pure over injected collaborators; shared by every wallet front end.
