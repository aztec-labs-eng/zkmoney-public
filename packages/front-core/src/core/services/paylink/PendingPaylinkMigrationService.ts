/**
 * PendingPaylinkMigrationService — the upgrade's deferred lane for paylinks it cannot move. A
 * creator paylink inside its claim window has no refund path (the contract asserts
 * chain time is past `until_claimable`), so the residual probe hands every still-escrowed historic
 * paylink to `recordPending` and `reconcile` re-derives each record from its row and chain time on
 * every boot. A `claimable` record gets one "reclaim" notice (fire-once by id, so a missed one is
 * recorded next boot);
 * the reclaim itself is the ordinary post-expiry refund, after which the returned balance is a
 * plain residual for the migration.
