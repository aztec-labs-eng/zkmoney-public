/**
 * TransferEventScanner — the chain-native source of the account's L2 transfer history.
 *
 * Reads the wallet's own private `Transfer` events from a persisted block cursor and writes a
 * verified row per event: a `receive` when the account is `to`, a `send` when it is `from` (the
 * token delivers every transfer to both parties, so a fresh client rebuilds what it sent too), and
 * a paylink claim row when the source verified the event's payout lane.
 * Nothing arrives off-chain: the sender's tag (and memo / request id) ride the event's `meta`, and
 * the tag is display attribution only — it is kept when the name registry resolves it to the
 * on-chain `from`, else the row shows the raw address and no contact is auto-added. Sends keep the
 * recipient L2 address so contact history can match it and resolve its display name; the recipient
 * tag the sender wrote into its own event copy is adopted as a contact under the same registry
 * check, against the on-chain `to`. Every downstream consumer (the bell, balance refresh, reorg
 * anchoring via `blockNumber`) reads the stored receive; sends only land in the store.
 *
 * Scans run in chunks of at most `MAX_BLOCKS_PER_TICK`; the cursor advances per completed chunk, in
 * one transaction with that chunk's rows, so a failure retries only its own chunk, never the whole
 * history. Only a pass's first chunk syncs PXE; the rest read at its anchor, since each new anchor
 * wipes the token's note discovery. The cursor never persists past the source's `anchorBlock` (PXE's synced block): head is the node tip,
 * but `listIncoming` only sees what PXE has decrypted, and PXE lags whenever a send pins the sync —
 * advancing to head would skip every block in the gap. The anchor is sampled BEFORE each list: it
 * is monotone, so a pre-read never exceeds the list's true coverage, while a post-read could claim
 * blocks a mid-pass sync added that the list never saw. While the anchor trails head a pass keeps
 * rescanning instead of idling, which re-triggers the very sync that advances the anchor. An anchor
 * below the cursor means PXE was rebuilt (store wipe, generation change) — the cursor rewinds to it
 * so the re-decrypted blocks are rescanned, just like a head that regressed below the cursor. A
 * registry outage holds the chunk's cursor so the range is retried; after `MAX_INGEST_ATTEMPTS`
 * failures the registry lookup — the only shed-able dependency — is dropped and the row is written
 * with the raw sender address, because PXE already validated the event itself: it must be recorded,
 * never skipped. Each pass rescans `REORG_MARGIN` blocks behind the cursor (the store's txHash
 * dedup makes that free).
 *
 * Every await that leaves the device is bounded by a timeout and ends when the pass is aborted, so
 * no hung RPC or registry fetch can wedge a pass or outlive it. A catch-up read gets a longer
 * bound: a fresh device's first note discovery can outlast the normal one, and a timed-out or
 * abandoned read keeps running in PXE's queue ahead of its retry.
 * While head is static a scheduled pass skips the scan entirely — `headBlock` is a plain node read
 * but `listIncoming` drags a full PXE sync behind it — with a periodic full pass so a static-head
 * rebuild is still caught. A `full` pass (a wake: resume, pull-to-refresh) never skips.
 *
 * Snapshot sources return events and balances from one validated PXE anchor. `onSynced` publishes
 * the snapshot before event attribution/persistence, so their failures cannot withhold a balance.
 * A throwing hook fails the pass and forces a full rescan next pass. The `transferScan` runtime
 * task schedules the passes.
