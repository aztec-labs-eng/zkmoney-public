/**
 * WalletSyncCoordinator — the one owner of the wallet's chain view. Each pass of its
 * `TransferEventScanner` (the only reader that syncs PXE) reads the private balances at the same
 * anchor and writes them to the balance store: Main's token, and any other the source reads
 * (Savings' shares). The UI renders from that store; nothing else in the app syncs PXE to read a
 * balance. The `transferScan` runtime task runs the passes.
 *
 * Every "refresh now" in the app wakes that task: pull-to-refresh and `loadAssets` through the
 * static `refresh()`, a send or withdrawal terminalising through the store watches below. The
 * watches diff terminal keys so pending-row progress writes never trigger a sync, and skip receive
 * rows because those are written by the pass itself. A write that moves the balance but no
 * `Transfer` event (a claimed deposit) uses `refreshBalance()` instead, which never waits behind a
 * scan pass.
 *
 * Its first published balance reaches `firstBalance`; its first pass to reach head, `historyAtHead`.
