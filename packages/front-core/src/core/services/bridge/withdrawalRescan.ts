/**
 * Rebuild the withdrawal records a store lost from the account's own recovery events. Every burn
 * the account made delivered its finalization data to it, which names the executor and the L1
 * address the burn pays, the amount and the relayer tip, and a swap's or a Sky move's memo also
 * carries the escrow args, so a fresh device gets its history back — and with it a stuck escrow's
 * exits — from chain alone.
 * Records the store already holds (by burn tx hash) keep their state, and one written before
 * executor stamps gets its burn's executor; the rest are created at `l2_mined` for the tracker to
 * walk forward like any mined burn. Pure over injected collaborators.
