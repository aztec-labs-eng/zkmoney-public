/**
 * ActivityFeed — Unified subscribe-able stream of activity items.
 *
 * The Activity tab and linked-wallet detail screen need one chronological feed

 * withdrawals; paylink, P2P, and request sources can be added by widening
 * ActivityItem instead of introducing parallel feeds that every consumer must
 * subscribe to.
 *
 * Eventually-consistent by construction — each store persists independently
 * via single-key IStorageAdapter writes. Snapshot consistency within a single
