/**
 * Single source of truth for deriving a 32-byte symmetric key from the master
 * secret and a domain separator.
 *
 * `poseidon2HashWithSeparator([secret], separator)` returns an `Fr` (a BN254
 * field element); `toBuffer()` always yields exactly 32 bytes (the top ~2 bits
 * are structurally zero, ~2^253.6 of key space — cryptographically irrelevant
 * for a local symmetric key). `AlphaAuthService.getDerivedKey`
 * implementations and the XMTP DB-key path delegate here so the derived bytes are identical by
 * construction rather than by copied conversion.
 *
 * The `domain` is looked up against {@link DOMAIN_SEPARATORS}; an unknown domain
 * throws before any hashing. Callers that already hold a typed
 * `KnownDerivedKeyDomain` get compile-time safety; the runtime check guards
 * `string`-typed callers (the `getDerivedKey(domain: string)` interface).
