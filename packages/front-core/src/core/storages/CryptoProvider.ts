/**
 * `CryptoProvider` — interface boundary between `EncryptedStorageAdapter`
 * (which lives in front-core) and the platform-specific key holder (e.g.
 * web's `MskWebCryptoProvider`).
 *
 * front-core cannot import platform key stores or the SDK's MSK plumbing, so
 * this 4-method shape lets the platform layer own everything key-related —
 * derivation, caching, invalidation — and front-core is just a consumer of
 * `encrypt(plaintext) → ciphertext` / `decrypt(ciphertext) → plaintext`.
 *
 * Key-rotation contract: when a fresh install or biometric re-auth produces
 * a new derived key, `keyAvailable()` may return false momentarily; consumers
 * of the adapter should treat decryption errors during `load()` as "drop the
 * record" rather than "crash the app" (see `EncryptedStorageAdapter.getItem`).
 *
 * Listeners registered via `onKeyChanged` fire when the underlying key
 * material changes. Subscribers (e.g. `PendingTxStore`) can use this to
 * invalidate caches and re-load.
