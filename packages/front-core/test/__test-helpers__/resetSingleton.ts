/**
 * Reset the `instance` field on a singleton class between tests.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   resetSingleton(WithdrawalStorage as unknown as { instance: WithdrawalStorage | null })
 *
 * The `as unknown as { instance: ... }` cast at the call site is deliberate —
 * the field is `private static`, and this helper keeps the non-goal "no
 * production-code changes" literally true. If `instance` is renamed, the
 * call sites break in one place rather than silently leaking state.
