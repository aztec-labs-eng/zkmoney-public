/**
 * Which tab of the origin runs the wallet, and the handoff when another tab takes it over.
 *
 * The active-tab lock names the tab that runs the wallet. A tab that finds it held shows "Use this
 * tab", which steals it. The old tab learns of the steal when its lock request rejects: it stops,
 * closes its databases and reloads.
 *
 * A steal tells the new tab nothing about when the old one has stopped. The databases do: each
 * takes its OPFS pool lock when it opens and refuses to open in another tab while that is held, so
 * the new tab retries opening until the old tab has closed them. A database in memory, used where
 * OPFS is unavailable, takes no pool lock, but it belongs to its page alone, so there is nothing
 * the new tab could see the old one write.
