/**
 * L1-leg funnel reporting for withdrawals. The tracker's phases and timestamps live in the
 * persisted record (`phaseEnteredAt` = when finalizing_l1 began, untouched by the `done` patch;
 * `endTime` = terminal stamp), so durations survive reloads — an L1 wait typically outlives the
 * tab. What must NOT survive twice is the report itself, so the reported-phase map persists via
 * the shared storage adapter, keyed by the withdrawal's random localId, and prunes to ids still
 * in the store. Reporting runs under a Web Lock so two tabs re-read and diff in turn instead of
 * both emitting. Only phase names and durations are emitted — never the recipient, amount, or
 * any hash.
