/**
 * Why an in-flight withdrawal is still waiting. Each post-mine phase waits on a different thing —
 * the Aztec tx, Ethereum accepting the withdrawal, a relayer's release, or the user's own release
 * tx — and only the first of those leaves the balance untouched, so the note says which one it is
 * and whether the amount is already gone. `finalizing_l1` splits on `finalizeTxHash`, and
 * `swapping` on `swapExecuteTxHash`: a transaction already in flight waits on itself, not on a
 * relayer.
