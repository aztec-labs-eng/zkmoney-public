 * gas share plus the route's floor, and the floor comes from pricing that very burn, so a change
 * prices the route twice: once to learn the floor, once with it included. The burn, gas share and
 * floor included, is one withdrawal under the per-withdrawal limit.

 * it ends, and the burn carries on under the bell, which reports its outcome. Cancel is honored only
 * while the burn is still building. A failure or a closed passkey prompt while the sheet is up
 * returns to confirm. `onDone` fires once: at the hand-off, or when the flow ends first.
