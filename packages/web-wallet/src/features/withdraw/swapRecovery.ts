/**
 * The two exits from a swap-on-withdraw escrow no relayer is running, in the browser: run the swap
 * yourself (`factory.deployAndExecute`, the tip comes back to you) or recover the DAI (`recoverERC20`,
 * to an address you name). A wallet's own escrow is signed by its Oxide account with its passkey; a
 * paylink visitor's is signed by the destination wallet with `personal_sign`. front-core's
 * `runSwapEscrowExecute` / `runSwapEscrowRecovery` own the calls, the commitment check and the
 * store write; this file supplies the browser collaborators — the L1 channel shared with the
 * deposit exits, the escrow reader, and the account, salt and passkey the recovery opens with.
