/**
 * Residual-funds probe over the retired oxide deployments (the other entries of `deployments[]`
 * the profile reaches). A historic
 * portal may still hold user value as a private balance on its l2Token, a SIPA deposit still in
 * transit or swept-but-unclaimed, or a paylink escrow that was never claimed/refunded. A paylink
 * still inside its claim window is reported separately: nothing can refund it until the window
 * closes, so the modal only announces it and the pending-migration store waits it out. The
 * migration-detected modal shows iff any historic deployment reports residuals — re-checked every
 * boot until drained, so there is no persisted "seen" state to go stale. On a frozen portal the
 * balance and the deposits are what is still refundable: a refund pays on L1 and leaves the L2
 * notes in place, and a deposit claimed on L2 after the freeze still refunds. The balance takes in
 * the open payment links, whose escrows refund to L1 too, so their rows start no L2 reclaim: notes
 * a reclaim makes after the freeze are outside the frozen snapshot.
 *
 * Each probe runs in its own try/catch: one failing deployment or probe must not hide residuals
 * the other probes found. A failed balance read or SIPA scan is reported as `incomplete`, so an
 * unread source never reads as an empty one.
