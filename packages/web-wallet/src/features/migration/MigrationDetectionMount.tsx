/**
 * Boot-time migration detection: derives where the signed-in account's upgrade stands from what it
 * still holds on a retired oxide deployment (`probeAccountResiduals`), its saved runs, the sponsored
 * rail's readiness and the registration check, and publishes it (`setUpgradeStatus`) for Home's
 * banner and the bell. The dialog opens only on a request. Mounted inside WalletGate (post-PXE,
 * post-unlock) because the probes need the wallet + account.
 *
 * Paylinks still inside their claim window cannot be refunded yet; `probeAccountResiduals` hands
 * them to `PendingPaylinkMigrationService`, which waits out the window and mints a reclaim
 * notification once chain time passes it.
 *
 * A failed check never breaks the wallet's boot: the state reads `failed`, and trying again checks
 * once more. Residuals with nothing to do right now become a notification.
