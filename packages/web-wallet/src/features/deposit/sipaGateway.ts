 * The SIPA deposit rail for the browser — the realistic L1→L2 funding path
 * (oxide's Segregated Incoming Payment Addresses), composing the front-core
 * wiring (`setupSipaDiscovery` / `syncSipaDeposits`) over a browser PXE.
 * Discovery and sync ride front-core, while this file owns the address-derivation cache, the
 * sponsored broadcast batch, and the L1 transfer. Every address it derives is owed to the broadcast
 * ledger, which proves its broadcast until it lands. The
 * wallet, the `ContractService` and the `TokenService` are INJECTED per call
 * from the shared front-core contexts — the gateway never builds its own.
 *
 * Receiving: the recipient derives its own deposit address rather than asking the resolver for one.
 * `SipaSelfResolver` hashes it from a key only this wallet holds — no gateway, no CCIP read, no
 * CORS. The relayer still has to learn the address exists, which is what the SIPA broadcast does
 * with no user signature: the token sends this wallet a `SIPA` event and the `Broadcaster`
 * publishes the sweep's L1 operation. The calls are whitelisted members of a ClaimFPC batch like
 * every other
 * sponsored call — the FPC only pays, and eligibility is the entrypoint's subscription — so a
 * first-ever Receive folds the deferred subscription into that same tx. From there the rail is
 * unchanged — a sender does a plain ERC-20 transfer, the relayer sweeps into the portal, this
 * wallet discovers the event, reads the L1 `Sweep` for the claim inputs, and lazy-claims via
 * `TokenService.claimSweptDeposit` (the free `store_deposit` utility sim) — after which the shared
 * asset layer's balance reflects the credit.
