/**
 * Claim lifecycle for an inbound paylink (ULT-671 pages 6–7). The prompt gives way to the claim
 * sheet for the beats that need the user present (Google sign-in, the zkJWT prove, the passkey).
 * The passkey ceremony is the last of those, so the sheet closes as it ends and the bell carries
 * the claim — the same hand-off a send makes. Success and failure land on the claim's operation
 * row; a failure before the hand-off also reopens the prompt behind an error sheet, since the
 * prompt is the retry. The stash clears on decline or success, so only an unresolved claim
 * re-prompts; a mount that finds its claim already running shows nothing, because the bell owns it.
 * Either flavor can instead burn to Ethereum: that runs as a withdrawal, whose stored record
 * carries its own live row.
 *
 * A link that paid for this account's signup is claimed by Home itself, publishing the
 * registration's address and burning its slice: the signup entered the wallet as soon as its name
 * was reserved, so the claim starts once the link's window is open and hands off to the bell at
 * once, with no review. That happens once per page and link, with two more tries after a read that
 * timed out; a claim that failed or was cancelled shows the review with its Claim for the retry,
 * and why it failed, as does an email-locked link, whose sign-in needs the tap. Closing the review
 * keeps the link stashed — the signup's funding waits for its claim, and Home's own try still runs.
 * A signup whose renewed quote the link can no longer pay, whose reservation lapsed or whose burn
 * already went out claims nothing and shows nothing here: the hero on Home says why, and the link
 * is still that signup's, never an ordinary claim, until the signup is renewed or abandoned.
