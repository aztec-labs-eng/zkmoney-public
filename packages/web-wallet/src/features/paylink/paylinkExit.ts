/**
 * The bearer cash-out: burn a vouchered link's escrow straight to an Ethereum address, for a holder
 * with no zk.money account.
 *
 * Nothing here touches an account. The escrow's keys come from the link, the fee comes from the
 * voucher its creator gifted it, and the enclave co-signs the burn as it does every token
 * operation. What the link cannot supply is the destination, so the address is screened at the
 * commit point exactly as the wallet's own withdraw screens it. The burn spends the whole escrow,
 * so a link over the per-withdrawal limit cannot be cashed out.
 *
 * The burn lands in the shared withdrawal store, so oxide's relayer finalizes it and the tracker
 * walks it to `done` like any other. Its provenance says nobody here owns the destination.
