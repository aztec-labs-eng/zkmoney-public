 * and sent once its withdrawal record shows the burn mined on L2, by whichever surface sees that
 * first. Keyed by the record's `paylinkId`; only the link hash, flavor and amount range are kept, and
 * only while analytics is on. Sending deletes the entry under a lock, so this browser sends a claim
 * at most once; delivery is the usual unacknowledged POST.
