 * Manual sweep for a funded registration deposit: the user submits the relayer's own
 * register-deploy-and-sweep for a SIPA no relayer picked up. It registers the name, pays the
 * on-chain registration fee out of the deposit (a broadcast-time waiver is honored), and bridges
 * the remainder — manual only skips the relayer, never the fee.
 *
 * Nothing extra is persisted for this path: one passkey assertion recovers the master secret, the
 * derivation is recomputed and checked against the record's address before anything is signed
 * (fail closed), and the NameClaim comes from the device cache or a claim-server re-request (see
 * `requireNameClaim`). The submission rides the same injected-wallet / desktop-bridge channel as
 * the plain deposit's self-sweep.
