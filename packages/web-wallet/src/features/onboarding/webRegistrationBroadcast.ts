 * D3a: publish a registration SIPA to relayers (registration-fee.md §Relayers). It rides the
 * one-shot `registration-broadcast` rail, so the tx that subscribes against the NameClaim also pays
 * for itself and spends the rail's only use.
 *
 * The batch carries no account call and needs no signature: the account has no setup step, and
 * the subscribe leg's eligibility is the NameClaim. A ticket-funded registration's claim sends it,
 * on this rail or in the claim's own batch.
 *
 * The plain-SIPA analogue is `sipaGateway.broadcastSipa`; registration rides the same `SIPA` event
 * and sweep broadcast — it is just one more intent (the registration record + its
 * consent/domain/waiver proofs) — and caches the fresh claim here so the subscribe leg can find it
 * (it can't be recovered from the `NameClaimed` log before registration).
