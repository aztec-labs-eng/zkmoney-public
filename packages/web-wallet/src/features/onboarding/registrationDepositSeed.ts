/**
 * Self-initiated intent tracking for registration deposits (sipa-intents.md §Wallet): the discovery
 * note carries no intent type, so a registration deposit's claim inputs must be recorded by the
 * wallet itself — this seeder writes them into the SIPA rail's store, whose known-address scan then
 * reads the L1 sweep and claims the bridged funds. `healRegistrationDeposits` covers records from
 * before the seeder existed (or whose seed was lost): with the wallet unlocked it re-derives each
 * custodial registration and seeds the ones whose address still re-derives.
