/**
 * Composes the subscribe leg a ClaimFPC-sponsored batch may carry.
 *
 * SUBSCRIPTION — does the user hold a subscription note for THIS RAIL of THIS ClaimFPC? Per
 * (instance, rail, account), `has_subscription`, answered by the chain rather than by local state.
 * Notes live in the deployed contract's storage and name their rail, so a redeployed FPC leaves
 * every existing user unsubscribed at once, and riding one rail says nothing about another.
 *
 * The eligibility witness that mints a subscription is not a second fact either — the rail's gate
 * says which one it takes, and both are recoverable from public L1 data plus the device master key.
 * A NameClaim gate takes the L1 claim, rebuilt from the Registry's `NameClaimed` log whenever the
 * local cache is missing; a registration gate takes the NamePortal's L1->L2 message, found by
 * scanning the Inbox (`registrationRail.ts`).
