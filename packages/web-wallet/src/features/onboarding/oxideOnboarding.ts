 * session is live would otherwise re-sign the live account before the switch and leave it so when
 * the attempt is cancelled or fails. A failure past the commit is reported as committed. The
 * attempt's cancel and the caller's `stillOwns` make one ownership predicate, asked before every
 * write up to the commit and by each store under its own lock: a cancel that landed on the way
 * ends in the cancel, and nothing is written after it. Past the commit the session names this
 * account, so its record and snapshot are finished whatever the attempt did; the commit's
 * generation is the ownership from then on, asked under the session lock — where a commit
 * publishes its tuple and moves the generation in one turn — as the record is rewritten, before
 * the account is built, and as its snapshot is saved: a newer commit or a sign-out since ends the
 * work as `SessionChangedError`, with nothing written into the session that replaced it, and a
 * commit cancelled as it saved is waited out, the session put back, the work going on.
 * The build itself is not fenced: an account a newer session outran may still be registered and
 * cached on the wallet; only what names the session is. The caller gets the account with `held`,

 * tag's HASH lives on-chain, so the plaintext still needs a source: a `handle` from the claim
 * link enters directly when its hash matches; otherwise the caller confirms. No anchor →
 * `unknown`, with nothing committed or written.
 *
 * `hints` names either a remembered credential, which pins the ceremony to it on any posture, or
 * the tag's L1 account with its keys: the sheet is then held to the credential ids the keys name
 * (a root's raw id, a backup's id behind its envelope). Either way the answering key is checked
 * against the signature, never trusted, and the anchors decide as always. `strictTag` (implied by
 * `hints`) lets only `handle` name the claim.
 * `cacheOnly` enters from a ceremony-free source or reports `ceremony-required` before any gate or
 * prompt; `restoreCache: false` keeps a tap-driven entry from starting the cache proof on its way to
 * the prompt. `signal` is the caller's cancel: with the gate's attempt it is checked before the
 * prompt, after the anchors, after the name read, and before every write, so nothing is committed
 * after a cancel.
