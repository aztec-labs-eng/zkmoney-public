/**
 * `requireTupleField` is the guard that turns a thin manifest into a named failure instead of a
 * TypeError deep inside a rail. Pinned here because the tests that depend on it used to mock a
 * STRICTER version than shipped, so a blank manifest field was "covered" by semantics production
 * did not have.
